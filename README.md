# pesaApp
PesaApp is a fast, secure and seamless money transfer application powered by M-Pesa.

PesaApp is a platform through which registered users can send and receive money within themselves.

Once the user creates an account, their information is stored on a database for `authentiication` purposes. I am using `firebase` for this purpose.

They can then log in with their email and password and be able to access their dashboard.

From the dashboard they can then send money to another registered user as well as top up their accounts.

These two functionaloties are powered by M-Pesa.

The Frontend is implemented using React and styling done using Bootstrap.
